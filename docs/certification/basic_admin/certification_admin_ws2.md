# Workshop {#workshop}

### Introduction {#introduction}
All Cotalker revolves around groups. There you can create channels where users chat or reply to forms. Imagine that on a specific channel, users can write the task for the week and manage the status according to whether they are doing it, solving or maintaining the sprint week, for example. Or you can simply use the channel to chat with other users. On the other hand, you can create a group as a hyperlink, which when you click on it redirects you to the specific link. For example, when you click on the documentation group, you are redirected to this web page. https://doc.cotalker.com/docs/intro_overview. <br/>
In this section of the admin you can creat, search, check and downloads the groups of the company.<br/>
