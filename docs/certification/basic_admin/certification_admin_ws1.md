### Introduction {#introduction}
**COMPANY** <br/>
The company is where the created users belong. For now, the user can only be related to one company, but in the future it could be more than one. <br/>
In this section of the admin, you can only edit aspects of the company.<br/>
For more details, go to the [admin's company section](/docs/documentation/admin/admin_company).

**USER**<br/>
Users are the basic unit of a company. This could be the representation of the people who works there or fictitious people. For example, a user may be the chief operating officer or a character who remainds you of pendings task.
In this section of the admin you can creat, search, check and downloads the users of the company.<br/>
For more details, go to the [admin's user section](/docs/documentation/admin/users).

**ACCESS ROLE**<br/>
In this section of the admin you can creat, search, check and downloads the access role of the company.<br/>
First of all, we already defined the access role as those that allow what and what not to read or modify in the Application. The privilages go from answering the survey from a specific channel to setting up the admin. The access role is made up of permissions that can be created or used by a default one (explained below). The created permission is given functionalities when other models are configured.<br/>
For more details, go to the [admin's access role section](/docs/documentation/admin/admin_accessrole).
