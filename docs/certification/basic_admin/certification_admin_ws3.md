### Introduction {#introduction}

Elements are used to establish a relationship or define something. That's why you can sometimes use an element as a resource or asset.<br/>
For example: send a specific text to the users who have the "Special Message" element, as you can see in the Users Section you can add elements.<br/>
Another example is that you must create the properties of the state to define them. Following the picture of the Overview section, you must have the elements "Headquarters Review", "CEOs Reviews", "Management Review", "Rejected Requests", and "Accepted Requests".<br/>

As you can see, the versatility of the elements is quite great.<br/>

On the other hand, the elements must belong to a collection. This is how you organize all of them.
