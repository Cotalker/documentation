## Chat & Automatization {#chat--automatization}

Communication tool for users and group of users to discuss, interact with bots or trigger actions. 

The "chat" is a frontend for interacting and triggering different systems, e.g., A survey can call a bot and extract data from the sales data base.
This presentation is intended to simplify the human-machine interface to a generic chat, and to normalize all systems to a simple view.

## Surveys {#surveys}

Surveys are the base tool for workflows. These allow users to start processes, report, change data, assign, among other actions, and execute any custom process adapted to your workflow.
