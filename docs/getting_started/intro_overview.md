## Product Summary {#cotalker-product-documentation}

*This guide is intended for comercial and technical users.* 
  
Cotalker is a Cross-Business Areas Solution, hosting different solutions in just one place. It can resolve many organizational and business solution challenges from basic communication, knowledge-base, asset management, task management, recruitment, onboarding, telemedicine, administrative requests, data collection and processing, alerts, automatizations, among many other processes. All this can be created with Cotalker's tools: channels, surveys, scheduled tasks, routine programming, state machines, among others.

Furthermore, Cotalker can be easily integrated with other software such as *SAP*, *Salesforce*, other *ERPs*, or directly to any API or database. Cotalker can contribute within the company ecosystem by generating data and executing operations.
Additionally, Cotalker uses the data flow to represent the company's Key Performance Indicator (KPI) – displayed on a dashboard. By default, our software offers standard KPI. However, it can also include customized indicators, or instead, we could bestow all the raw data to the company for its own data analysis.

Likewise, there are different ways to manage and control the data – thinking about who will have access to it: an employee, the manager, or the CEO. In the case of employees, they will have access to the results from the surveys they make. Then there's the manager, who can view the data from a task view, control and manage the list of tasks or activities of a team or person, and access the list of answered surveys – which they can additionally download. Finally, the CEO can access the KPIs – displayed on a dashboard – and the information of a company asset, such as a customer or store, among others.
  
Some of the solutions that Cotalker provides to its clients are:
- Internal Helpdesk from a databank using knowledge base.
- Ticket raising, using workflows.
