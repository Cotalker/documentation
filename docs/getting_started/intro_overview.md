_Cotalker has the power to contribute within a company's ecosystem by generating data and executing operations._

Easily integrate other software such as *SAP*, *Salesforce*, other *ERPs*, or directly to any API or database. 

Additionally, Cotalker uses the data flow to represent the company's Key Performance Indicator (KPI) – displayed on dashboards. By default, our software offers standard KPI. However, it can also include customized indicators; alternatively, we could bestow all the raw data to the company for its own data analysis.

Furthermore, there are different ways to manage, control, and view the data – thinking about who will have access to it, i.e., an employee, manager, CEO, etc.
