## Overview {#overview}

For end-users, Cotalker is a tool that allows them to plan, execute, and communicate information. For administrators, it's all about building arbitrary workflows and processes. Here we'll explain its most notable features.

<!--

## Tasks & State Machines {#tasks--state-machines}

You can view, edit, create tasks, and change their state and data. The tasks view allows filtering and grouping by states, assignments, users, among others.

## Chat {#chat}

*Communication tool for users and groups of users to discuss, interact with bots, or trigger actions.*

The "chat" is a frontend for interacting and triggering different systems, e.g., a survey can call a bot and extract data from the sales database. This interface simplifies human-machine interactions into a generic chat and normalizes all systems into a simple view.

## Surveys {#surveys}

Surveys are the base tool for workflows. These allow users to – among others – start processes, make reports, change data, assign tasks, and execute any custom process adapted to your workflow.
