Tutorial on how to configure a _company_. 

Time: 7 minutes

:::tip Vocabulary note:
- A _company_ is the institution that will be using the Cotalker App. All _companies_ have to configure the app to their characteristics and needs. 
- For the sake of this tutorial, the _company_ will be already created, but it needs to be configured.

## Company Requirements {#company-requirements}
#### Tutorial Objectives {#tutorial-objectives}

As mentioned in the [Overview](../tutorial_overview), we will be working with a make-believe company for this tutorial. Our mock company is _Ruanda_. Below, we will see their first requirements for installing the app.

- First, they have different job positions that need to be added to the software, such as:
  - CEO
  - head of financial control
  - financial controller
  - developer
  - chief of cyber security
  - secretary
  - head of commercial division
  - executive
  - head of the treasury division
  - accounting
  - head of the marketing division
  - advertiser
  - head of risk control
  - risk analyst
  - head of human resources
  - psychologist
  - IT boss

- They have also requested that, when a new user logs into the app for the first time, their terms of services be displayed.

- The company resides in Chile, so its language preference is Spanish.
