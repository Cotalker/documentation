Tutorial on using the _conditional display_ option to make a dynamic survey.

Time: 10 minutes

## Company Requirements {#company-requirements}
Our mock company, Ruanda, has a little problem with the task manager shown previously. The company's technical areas would like to have another field in the survey called *difficulty rating* (number field), but it isnÂ´t necessary for the other departments.<br/>
We will now work to offer a dynamic survey, where the user's department will act as a filter for opening other fields.

## Pre-Requistes {#pre-requisites}
#### Access Role
* _User_ with the `admin-statemachines-write`, `admin-bots-write`, `admin-properties-write`, and `admin-groups-write` permissions to create and modify workflows, bots, elements, and groups. 
* Or`admin-*-write` which allows all of the above. 
* User with the `read admin` access role.

#### Survey
* Having completed the [Survey that Starts a Workflow Tutorial](create_survey_sm).
