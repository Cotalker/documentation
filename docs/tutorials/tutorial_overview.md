## Introduction {#introduction}

For our tutorial, we will be working with a make-believe situation. In this scenario, Cotalker closed a contract with a new financial company, Ruanda. Its digitalization process will undertake different company aspects: eliminating paperwork, reducing work time, and organizing information in one place.

For this new company, configuring the app will progress from basic to advanced settings. Each step of the tutorial will introduce new company requirements that will help you progressively discover how to use all of Cotalker's functions and abilities.

The processes covered in the following sections will range from human resources to the management of different company areas. The tutorial will guide you on creating a company chat, welcoming a new employee, making a task manager for the cybersecurity department, and configuring an approval manager for supervisors.
