## Description

Tasks are hosted within [Task Groups (COTTaskGroup)](/docs/documentation/models/tasks/model_taskgroup) and carry out their lifecycle through a [workflow](/docs/documentation/admin/workflows/admin_workflow_overview). The task data model (COTTask) contains a task's settings information.
