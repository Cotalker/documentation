With **Notes**, users can collaborate with all sorts of information to build your company's knowledge base. \n\nThe **Notes** tool uses [markdown syntax](/docs/documentation/client/notes_markdown) to help you focus on writing the text and forget about formatting. _Notes_ can be incorporated into _tasks_, shared through hyperlinks, managed in the _Notes dashboard_, and submitted through _surveys_. Furthermore, _notes_ associated with _tasks_ are included in _search queries_, making your shared knowledge accessible to all users within your company's Cotalker platform.\n\n**Notice:** While _notes_ are fully available in _tasks_, the _Notes dashboard_ is still in its _alpha_ phase and is subject to change.\n\n-------"
