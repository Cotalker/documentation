## Overview {#overview}

Easily create notes to share and edit in real-time among other users within the Cotalker environment. With _Notes_, users can collaborate with all sorts of information to build your company's knowledge base.

The _Notes_ tool uses [markdown syntax](#markdown) to help you focus on writing the text and forget about formatting. 

Notes can be shared through hyperlinks, the _Notes_ dashboard, [_tasks_](#task-notes), and even [_surveys_](/docs/documentation/admin/survey/components/attachment).

## Accessing Notes Dashboard {#dashboard}

## Creating Notes {#create-note}

## Markdown Syntax {#markdown}

Editing _notes_ requires using markdown, which is a very simple syntax used for applying format to your document. It’s easy to use. You just have to remember some of the character-syntax commands. Once you get the hang of it, you’ll end up liking markdown more than regular word processing, especially when you need to make quick notes and not worry much about formatting.
