import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'; 



The **task workspace** allows users to access a task's chat channel, files and notes associated with the task, and task settings. Through these sections, users associated with a task can communicate, share data, update tasks, and much more.

Task workspaces are viewable from [_list_](#list-view) and [_kanban_](#kanban-view) views. By simply clicking on a _task_, a side panel opens on the right side of the screen with access to the task's workspace. 

_Below is an example of how the task workspace is accessed:_

<img alt="task workspace" className="img_sizing item shadow--tl" src={useBaseUrl('img/task_workspace_access_00.gif')} />

_Task workspace layout:_

<img alt="task workspace" className="img_sizing item shadow--tl" src={useBaseUrl('img/task_workspace_access_00.png')} />
