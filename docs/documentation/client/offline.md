## Overview {#overview}

The _Cotalker app_ is constantly synchronizing with servers sending and retrieving the latest information shared on an organization's _Cotalker platform_. But in cases in which internet access is not available, users on mobile devices can activate the **Offline Mode**. With this feature, users can still work with the latest synchronized data on their mobile app and automatically update changes they made as soon as an internet connection is reestablished.

:::caution
**Offline Mode** works only on mobile devices and only certain specific actions can be carried out without an internet connection.
:::

:::info
The **Offline Mode** is a feature that must be requested and configured in order for it to be available in your organization's Cotalker experience.

## Synchronization {#sync}

To understand how **Offline Mode** works, we should review some basic notions of how the Cotalker app synchronizes data, i.e., sending and receiving data between the user's device and the platform's server.

The Cotalker app synchronizes data in the background. This allows users to initiate and start using the app while still in the course of synchronization. Synchronization is an ongoing process, that allows users to work with the latest data.

## Offline Features

In case you lose your internet connection, you can continue to work using the **Offline Mode** with the latest data that was synced to your device. Any input you add will be automatically sent to the server once an internet connection is reestablished.

:::caution
If **Offline Mode** is not set when you don't have access to the internet, the app will try to unsuccessfully connect to the internet. This will prevent it from showing any data and correctly updating any changes you made while offline.
