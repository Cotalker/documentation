title: Surveys with Automations

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'; 

Automations can also be built into the survey, allowing automatic actions or data gathering to take place either when the survey is being filled out or when it has been finally submitted. For example, notifications can be sent to interested parties, data can be used to calculate costs, and much more.

_Below is a simple example of a bot that sends to the channel an automatic message and a GIF image from an external website after a new employee submits a personal information survey._

<img alt="surveys with bots" className="img_sizing item shadow--tl" src={useBaseUrl('img/client_survey_03.png')} />

_Notice how, in the example above, the bot takes data from the survey answers to carry out its routine._
