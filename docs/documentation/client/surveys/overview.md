## Introduction {#intro}
_Surveys_ are a significant feature inside the Cotalker environment that help gather data from _users_. Usually created by _admins_, _surveys_ have a form-like aspect that makes it easier for _users_ to fill them out.

Diverse data can be entered through _surveys_, such as written text, multiple-choice questions, date and time, ratings, location, images, and even QR Code and NFC input on mobile apps.

A _survey_ can even require you to sign your name using a pointing device, such as a mouse or your finger if you're using a mobile device.

Answered surveys appear within the corresponding _channel workspace_, they can also be retrieved in the [Reports](/docs/documentation/client/reports) section.

## Examples {#examples}
_Example of a survey used for creating a corrective maintenance task:_

<br/>
<br/>

_Below is an example of a submitted survey displayed in the task's channel. The task and its channel were automatically created with the submission of the survey:_

<img alt="survey in channel" className="img_sizing_small item shadow--tl" src={useBaseUrl('img/client_survey_01.png')} />
<br/>

On the task channel, all _users_ associated with the task can reference the data submitted through the survey. _Users_ can continue to communicate with each other through the channel to ask for specifications, add more context, share updates, or anything else relevant to the task.

## Public Surveys {#public}
Surveys can also be made public, allowing them to be answered and submitted by anyone outside the Cotalker environment.
