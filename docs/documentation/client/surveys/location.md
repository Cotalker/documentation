Surveys can also ask users to input map locations. Depending on the question's configuration, users will be able to either send only their current GPS location or choose to among their current location or any other location they wish.

_Below is an example of a survey question that allows users to freely choose a location._

<img alt="survey+gps" className="img_sizing item shadow--tl" src={useBaseUrl('img/client_survey_location_00.png')} />

<div className="margin-left--lg">

- **A.** Type a location address manually.
- **B.** Choose to send your current location
- **C.** Double-click with the cursor on the map to indicate the location.
- **D.** This cancels any changes made on the map.
- **E.** This adds the location to the survey as an answer.
