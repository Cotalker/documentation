import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl'; 


The _Actions button_ is a green button floating near the bottom of the [group panel](/docs/documentation/client/groups#group-panel). It can perform the following actions:
- In [_workflow groups_](/docs/documentation/client/groups#workflow-groups), create [tasks](/docs/documentation/client/taskview) with surveys.
- In [_regular groups_](/docs/documentation/client/groups#regular-groups), create new [channels](/docs/documentation/client/channels).
- In all groups, there can be links to any URL.

_The **actions button** will look something like the image below:_
<img alt="fab" class="img_sizing item shadow--lw" src={useBaseUrl('img/client_actionsbutton_01.png')} />
