## General Description {#descriptions}

_Groups_ are the primary place to interact and exchange information in the Cotalker environment. From a group's panel, you can go to [channels](/docs/documentation/client/channels) and subgroups. Depending on the type of group, you can create and view [tasks](/docs/documentation/client/taskview), create other channels, or access a link to other information.

## Group Types {#group-types}
_Groups_ – which can only be created by administrators – are classified into three kinds:

### Regular Groups {#regular-groups} 
Normally, we refer to _regular groups_ simply as _groups_.They incorporate a list of users and include _channels_, i.e., chat rooms for messaging and answering surveys. Groups can have subgroups and more than one channel. 

### Workflow Groups {#workflow-groups}
Similar to regular groups, they include channels and subgroups. Their great advantage is that they host _tasks_  with their corresponding _channels_. You can access task details either through the _group panel_ or the _channel workspace_.

### Link Groups {#link-groups}
This kind of _group_ is a _link_ which can be found in the _main menu bar_ or _group panel_. It can redirect the user to another source of information, whether it be internal or external to the Cotalker environment.
