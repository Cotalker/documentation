## Introduction {#introduction}
Channels allow quick and transparent communication between people working on a _task_ or project. At first, a _channel_ looks primarily like a *chatroom*, but they are much more than that:

- All channels exist within [regular or workflow groups](/docs/documentation/client/taskview).
- If the channel is found within a [workflow group](/docs/documentation/client/groups#workflow-groups) and is associated with a [task](/docs/documentation/client/taskview), you can configure a task, change its state, and interact with those involved.
- All channels can be set up with [surveys](/docs/documentation/client/surveys) that users can fill out and send.
- Depending on access roles, users can include other users into the channel.

:::note How to create new channels
- In [regular groups](/docs/documentation/client/groups#regular-groups), new channels can be created using the [group panel's](/docs/documentation/client/groups#group-panel) [_actions button_](/docs/documentation/client/actions_button).
- In [workflow groups](/docs/documentation/client/groups#workflow-groups), new channels are created along with [tasks](/docs/documentation/client/taskview).

## How to access a Channel
