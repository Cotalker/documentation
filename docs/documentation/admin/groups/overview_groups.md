## Overview {#overview}

_Regular Groups_, commonly referred to as simply _"groups"_, are to be differentiated from _workflow (task) groups_ and _link groups_. As the other group types, _regular groups_ can be accessed through the **Main Menu Bar** or in the **Group Panel** as sub-groups of other groups. _Regular groups_ are mainly used for communication purposes. Users can be added as participants in the group, allowing them to use the group panel's _actions button_, access _sub-groups_, open _link groups_, access the group's _channels_, and other resources that can be added to a group and its channels. 

Through _Channel Workspaces_ within _Regular Groups_, users associated to the channel can send messages, share files, answer surveys, and view other users participating in the channel.
