## Channels {#channels}
_Workflow groups_ and _communication groups_ can have _channels_. A _channel_ is where two or more Cotalker _users_ can interact with each other, or where one or more _users_ can answer and send a _survey_ to a state machine, in other words, upload information that is used in a company process. Or it could be used to progress through all the task/opportunity/asset states of a process.

<!-- TODO add reference to workgroup channels -->

### Communication Group Channels {#communication-group-channels}
Within the **Groups** option - under _sections_ in the _administrative panel_ â€“ you can find the entire list of _communication groups_ that have been created. By pressing an individual _communication group_ (indicated in the settings panel simply as **groups**), you will see all the _channels_ created in that group. If you would like to create a _channel_ within the _communication group_, please refer to the next section.
