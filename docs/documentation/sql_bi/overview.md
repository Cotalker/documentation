Cotalker integrates SQL and Business Intelligence (BI) tools to transform raw data into information businesses and organizations can visualize to monitor processes and make informed decisions.

Our software generates a read-only SQL database which is stored in our servers and visualized using [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/), a third-party BI platform. With Metabase, you can create customized searches and displays that will truly enhance what you can do with your data.

_With Metabase, we can help you search and visualize your data._
