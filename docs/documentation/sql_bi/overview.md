## Overview {#overview}

Cotalker integrates SQL and Business Intelligence (BI) tools to transform raw data into information businesses and organizations can visualize to monitor processes and make informed decisions.

Using SQL, our software generates a read-only database that is accessed through [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/), a third-party BI platform.

- For **enterprise plans**, it is possible to have direct access to the SQL Database from a third party BI platform. _Contact your Cotalker sales representative for more information._
