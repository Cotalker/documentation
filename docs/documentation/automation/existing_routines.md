## Overview {#overview}

**Routine stage types** can be thought of as _stage bots_ or _predefined routines_. By using these bots, you can easily automate processes by being part of [routines](/docs/documentation/automation/admin_routine) summoned through surveys, slash commands, SLAs, workflows, and others.


## Stage Types List {#stage-list}
Stage Types are explained in the following table:

## Stage Type Versions {#stage-type-versions}

_Stage types_ are actually predefined system bots. Every once in a while, we update these bots, adding new features and options or just improving automations. But, because these changes might affect your existing _routines_, access to older versions is available.

You can see where the _version_ field is located and how versions can have different settings in the following image:

:::caution Attention
- In case a new version is available, an alert message will appear in the settings panel.
- If you change the version of a stage type, you will not go back to previous versions after saving.
