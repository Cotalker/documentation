## Overview {#routine-overview}

The _Routine Builder_ is used to build routines in _Workflows_, _Bots_, _Schedules_, and _SLAs_. This section explains how to build a _routine_ within the mentioned processes.

_Routines_ are used to configure various actions within a company. For example, you can automate the sending of an email or a message, create a task, or change a workflow from one state to another.

- Check out the [list](/docs/documentation/automation/existing_routines#stage-list) of automations that you can include in your _routines_.

- Test your _routines_ with the [automation log](#run-routine).

The settings panel shows a visualization of the _routine_ that has been created. A _routine_ is built by a set of _stages_ or _steps_ that can function in different ways according to the chosen type. In general, [stage types](#stage-type-list) can do the following:

* help with configuration
* make decisions based on context
* network request
* interact with the user
* edit workflow components
* update workflow components

## Routine Setup {#setup-the-routine}

Below you will find the description and notes for each field in the Routine Builder's settings panel.

| Field | Description | Notes | 
| ---- | ----------- | ----- | 
| Initial State | Select the stage that initializes the routine. | The list shows the stages that have been created so far in this particular routine. You can fill in this field after you have added the stage or stages. |
| Max Iterations | Specifies the number of stages iterated. | Make sure looping stages are taken into account when specifying the maximum number of iterations. |
| Add Stage | Adds a stage to the routine. | The _code_ and _stage type_ must be specified. After that, the settings for the selected stage type will be displayed. |
| Code | Stage identification name | This field only allows lowercase letters, underscores and should always start with a letter.  |
| Type | Select the stage type. | The dropdown menu lists all the available _stage types_. Hover over the name for a brief explanation. [Click here](/docs/documentation/automation/existing_routines#stage-list) for more information. |
| Version | Select the stage type version. | Available versions will appear in the dropdown menu. For more information, [click here](/docs/documentation/automation/existing_routines#stage-type-versions).|

## Stage Type Configuration {#configure-stage-types}
After selecting <span className="badge badge--primary">+ Add Stage</span>, there are various _stage types_ that can be chosen and configured. 

The **Type** field has a dropdown menu with a list of all the available _stage types_. If you hover over the name, a brief explanation of the function will be displayed.

Once the type is selected, its specific settings fields will be displayed.

_For example, if you chose the **Send gif** stage type, you will see the following fields appear:_

<img alt="type fields" className="img_sizing_narrow item shadow--tl" src={useBaseUrl('img/automations_routines_02.png')} />
<br/>

- **Options**: In this example, the **Send gif** stage type has three options or fields: _Search_, _Channel_, and _User_.
- **Required Fields**: The _required_ fields are outlined by a red box (_Search_ and _Channel_).
- **General Field Description**: The field highlighted in red has its name at the top left (in this case: "CHANNEL"). Next to it, you can find the field's _specifications_ ("REQUIRED") and the _input type_ ([COTCHANNELID](admin_cotlang)). In italic letters, at the bottom of the box, is the explanation of the expected input ("ID OF THE CHANNEL TO WHICH THE GIF WILL BE SENT").

**Note:** _It's common to use [COTLang](admin_cotlang) (Cotalker Script Language) for getting automatized data for fields._

## Run Routine {#run-routine}

<img alt="run routine" className="img_sizing item shadow--tl" src={useBaseUrl('img/automations_log_06.png')} />
<br/>

The <span className="badge badge--primary">Run Routine</span> button is a blue button found in the *Routine Builder*. This button opens up an automation log that will help you test and debug your routines while still building them.

To learn more about the log information shown in **Run Routine**, please refer to [Automation Log](/docs/documentation/automation/automation_log).

:::warning
*Run Routine* is **not** a "playground" or "sandbox". The routine will actually execute all the steps. So, for example, if you program the routine to send an email, it will really send the email.
You can insert mock data into the *Context* editor to avoid mishaps.
