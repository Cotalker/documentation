## What is the "Work Orders" product? {#what-does}

With the **Work Orders** product, your _work orders_ are transformed into workflows, allowing you to have complete control over the whole process. In summary, you can submit work order forms, contact service teams or contractors, communicate with each other during the operation, evaluate jobs, and close work orders all in one place.

**Work Orders**, as a stand-alone product, is composed of the [Work Orders Workflow](/docs/products/workflows/work_orders/overview_intro) and the [Quotes Workflow](/docs/products/workflows/budget_management/overview). 

:::note
The [**Corrective Maintenance**](/docs/products/corrective_maintenance/cm_overview) and[ **Preventive Maintenance**](/docs/products/preventive_maintenance/pm_overview) products include the **Work Orders** product in their process.

## How does it work? {#how}

The **Work Orders** product makes getting things done a lot easier. As stated above, **Work Orders** can be used independently or in conjunction with other maintenance products.

<br/>

_Whether used separately or with other products, the procedure is as follows:_

- If using **Corrective Maintenance**, an incident must be first reported and validated before creating the _work order_.
- If using **Preventive Maintenance**, a _work order_ can be made when the corresponding maintenance check comes up.
- A _work order_ form is filled out within the _Work Orders_ workflow.
- After submitting the form, the service team or a contractor will be notified that their service is required. 
- They can then view the _work order_ and any other shared information before deciding to accept the request or not.
- After filling out the _Accept Work Order_ form, they can also fill out the _New Quote_ form to inform supervisors and budget managers of the cost of the service. Managers are able to discuss costs with contractors and decide to approve or not the quote.
- Once the job is done, maintenance personnel can request to close the _work order_.
- Supervisors must then inspect the work done and give their approval.
- After closing, supervisors can send an evaluation form that the maintenance team will also be able to see.
- If used in conjunction with other products, their respective workflows can also be closed.

Supervisors initiate by sending contractors a _work order_, allowing them to review details and decide whether to accept the job or not. Contractors can then submit a _quote_ form that is shared with stakeholders for review. Contractors send the _close work order_ form upon job completion for the supervisor's approval.
