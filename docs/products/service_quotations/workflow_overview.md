The Service Quotations workflow uses survey forms to gather information from external users and the company's master data, which is then used to generate a service quotation. If approved, the data on the service quotation is used to generate a _service order_, thus initiating the [service orders workflow](/docs/products/service_orders/so_overview).

## Glossary {#glossary}

- **Service Quotation**: A document given by a service provider to a client or prospect for approval detailing information on the costs of services and materials of required service.
- **Service Order**: A document given by a service provider to a client containing information on the costs of services and materials of contracted service. [Cotalker Service Orders](/docs/products/service_orders/so_overview) helps automate the service order process, from document generation to job completion.
- **Public Survey**: A [public survey](/docs/documentation/admin/workflows/admin_workflow_public_survey) is a Cotalker feature that grants external users access to workflow start form through a link that can be shared or embedded on a webpage. In this case, external users can initiate the Service Quotations workflow to request a service quotation.
- **Master Data**: Master data is the company data that Cotalker works with. In this workflow, master data includes  – but is not limited to – inventory, services, materials, staff, locations, equipment, and clients. Learn how to [configure your company's master data](/docs/products/setup/master_data).
