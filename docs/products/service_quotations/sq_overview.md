## What is Cotalker Service Quotations? {#what-is}

The Service Quotations product allows service providers to share quotation request forms with clients and prospects outside the Cotalker platform and automatically generate quotations.

The quotation request forms can be publicly shared through a link or a web page with the embedded form. Service providers can generate quotations that automatically use the client's information and the master data related to services, materials, costs, workers, and the provider's contact information. 

## How's the process? {#how}

<br/>

1. The client submits a form requesting a quote.
2. The service provider is notified through the Cotalker platform and is prompted to accept or reject the request.
3. From the Cotalker platform, the service provider fills out a form to generate the quotation. The form is linked to master data containing the costs and availability of services, materials, and staff.
4. Once the quotation is generated, the client automatically receives an email containing a PDF version of the quotation and a link to the Approve Service Quotation form. Upon review of the quotation, the client can access the public form and choose to accept or reject the quotation. 
5. If the client accepts the quotation, a service order is automatically generated.
