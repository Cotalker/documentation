## Introduction {#intro}

Layla works for a small farming company that needs to drill a well. They found a company called Lorem that does just that. They happen to use Cotalker Service Quotations to allow its prospects to request a quotation. On their website, there's a link that opens up a form powered by Cotalker. Layla opens the link and enters her company's contact info and service request on the form. Once submitted, the well-drilling company will get notified.

On the other side, Ogechi, who works for Lorem, receives the request and opens up a form to generate a service quotation. The form is connected to the company's master data, so Ogechi only has to select the corresponding items from the menu. The form will automatically calculate costs, generate the service quotation with all the details, and send it to the email that Layla stipulated on the request form.
