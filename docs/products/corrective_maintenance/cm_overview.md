## Why "Corrective Maintenance"? {#why}

Sometimes things break. And when that happens, you need to fix them as soon as possible. But the process between reporting a maintenance issue and actually solving the problem can take some time. 

Cotalker's **Corrective Maintenance** product offers a mobile solution to fieldwork problems, agilizing the process with its notification forms, work orders, automations, and direct communication with all stakeholders.

## How does Corrective Maintenance work? {#how}

**Corrective Maintenance** consists of three integrated workflows that connect stakeholders to maintenance issues, allowing them to report incidents, share information, and request validation to pass to the next stage in the process. 

Supervisors, field workers, maintenance personnel, and budget managers can participate during the whole process.

<span className="hero__subtitle"><b>ðŸ”” Notifications Workflow</b></span> 

Field workers notify failures by filling out a form. This initiates the _Notifications_ workflow and alerts corresponding stakeholders. Supervisors then can either validate or reject the _new incident report_.

<span className="hero__subtitle"><b>ðŸ§¾ Work Orders Workflow</b></span> 

Once the notification is validated, supervisors can send contractors a _work order_, allowing them to review details and decide whether to accept the job or not. Contractors can then submit a _quote_ form that is shared with stakeholders for review. Contractors send the _close work order_ form upon job completion for the supervisor's approval.

<span className="hero__subtitle"><b>ðŸ’² Quotes Workflow</b></span> 

Contractors automatically send quotes to stakeholders when filling out the quote form in the _work orders workflow_. Stakeholders can review the quote and approve or reject it.
