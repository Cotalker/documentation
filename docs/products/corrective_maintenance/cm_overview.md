## Why "Corrective Maintenance"? {#why}

Sometimes things break. And when that happens, you need to fix them as soon as possible. But the process between reporting a maintenance issue and actually solving the problem can take some time. 

Cotalker's **Corrective Maintenance** product offers a mobile solution to fieldwork problems, agilizing the process with its notification forms, work orders, automations, and direct communication with all stakeholders.

## How does Corrective Maintenance work? {#how}

**Corrective Maintenance** consists of three integrated workflows that connect stakeholders to maintenance issues, allowing them to report incidents, share information, and request validation to pass to the next stage in the process.

_Corrective Maintenance workflows:_
  - [Notifications](/docs/products/workflows/notifications/overview): Field workers notify failures by filling out a form. This initiates the corrective maintenance workflow and alerts corresponding stakeholders. Immediately, a supervisor is notified and has the option to either validate or reject the new incident report.
  - [Work Orders](/docs/products/workflows/work_orders/overview): Once the notification is validated, supervisors can create fill out a dynamic work order form that initiates a new workflow. The work order is then sent to technical personnel, who can accept or reject the work order. If accepted, technical personnel evaluate the situation and fill out a quote form for review. Once the job is complete, techincal personnel send the _close work order_ form. A supervisor can then either accept to close the work order or give more indications if not satisfied.
  - [Purchase Orders](/docs/products/workflows/budget_management/overview): Contractors automatically send quotes to budget managers when filling out the quote form in the _work orders workflow_. Managers must see if the accept the quote or not.

  Supervisors, field workers, technical teams, and budget managers can participate during the whole process.

## Examples {#examples}
### Service Station Maintenance {#service-station}

Let's say a service station worker discovers a problem with a gas pump. How do they communicate this and get it fixed? Easy. They just have to open the Cotalker app on their smartphone to report the failure. They can even add a photo of the maintenance issue to help the team evaluate the problem.

<br/>

Once the report is submitted, the zone supervisor gets automatically notified on their Cotalker app. The supervisor reviews the submitted information and has the option of either disregarding the incident or validating it. After validating, the supervisor can submit a work order that is sent to available contractors, who are also connected through the Cotalker platform. 

The notified contractors can accept or decline the work order. If they accept, they are added to the workflow process. Once they are on terrain and evaluate the incident for themselves, they can send a quote by submitting a form from the task workspace. The quote is automatically shared with the budget manager.

<br/>

After the contractors consider they have finished their job, they close the work order by submitting another form. The supervisor can then approve or reject the job. Once approved, the work order is closed.

It's that simple!
