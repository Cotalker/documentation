## Accept Work Order Form {#accept}

When time or value triggers are set off, a work order is automatically sent to contractors or maintenance teams. They can view the work order's details, ask for more details through the channel, and accept the job by submitting a form.

<div className="alert alert--primary">

_To accept the job:_

<img alt="accept work order" className="img_sizing item shadow--tl" src={useBaseUrl('img/products/product_preventive_wo_accept_00.png')} />
<br/>

1. Go to the **Main Menu Bar** and press <span className="badge badge--primary">Work orders</span>.
2. From the **Work orders** panel, choose the _reported_ maintenance task.
3. In the channel workspace, view work order details.
4. At the bottom of the workspace, press the green button to open the **Accept Work Order** form.

</div>

_The **Accept Work Order** appears as follows:_

<img alt="accept work order form" className="img_sizing item shadow--tl" src={useBaseUrl('img/products/product_preventive_wo_accept_01.png')} />
