1. **Reported**: A supervisor has filled out and submitted the _Create Work Order_ form. Technical teams and contractors are informed of the work order. They can now review the information, ask for more details, and view its history. To pass to the workflow's next step, a technical team or contractor must accept the work order by submitting the _Accept Work Order_ form.
2. **Pending**: The work order has been accepted by a technical team or contractor, and now they must complete the job. During this part of the process, contractors can send a quote for review, commencing a parallel workflow.
3. **Validation**: Once the job has been completed, workers send the _Close Work Order_ form, thus commencing the _Validation_ step of the workflow. Now, supervisors must validate the job by submitting the _Acceptance of Work_ form. If it is not validated, the workflow goes back to _pending_. Otherwise, it passes to the _closed_ state.
4. **Closed**: If the supervisor validates the completion of the job, then the workflow passes to the _Closed_ state, thus ending the workflow.
5. **Rejected**: This state is not used in the current workflow, but left in place for future customizations.
