With Cotalker's survey forms, the **Work Orders** workflow lets you easily manage your _work orders_ from start to finish. Once the _work order_ is created, it is sent to technical teams and contractors, requesting them to fill out a form to accept it or not. If accepted, they can send a quote, exchange information, and close the work order. Once maintenance personnel request to close the work order, a supervisor reviews the completed job. If satisfied, they fill out the **Acceptance of Work** form, and the work order is officially closed.

:::note
When used within the [Corrective Maintenance](/docs/products/corrective_maintenance/cm_overview) product, supervisors can create _work orders_ upon receiving a maintenance _notification_.
Within [Preventive Maintenance](/docs/products/preventive_maintenance/pm_overview), work orders are created automatically when programmed maintenance checks come up.
