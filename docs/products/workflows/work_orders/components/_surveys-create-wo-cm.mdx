When using [Corrective Maintenance](/docs/products/corrective_maintenance/cm_overview), the form is brief due to the fact that the details are already registered in the [notification](/docs/products/workflows/notifications/overview).

Once submitted, the _work order_ workflow initiates and is set to the first state, i.e., _reported_. Simultaneaously, the form is sent to technical teams or contractors to request their services.
