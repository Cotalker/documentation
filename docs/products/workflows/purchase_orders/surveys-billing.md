<br/>

Invoice and billing information can also be registered by accounting personnel. The form used for this purpose is connected with your master data, making supplier info and banking details to be easily available. If delivery of goods and services is segmented, the billing form uses registered received goods and services, along with previously paid invoices, to ensure the correct amounts are paid and registered.
