The **Purchase Orders workflow** carries out the entire purchase order process. It begins with an authorized user submitting a form to create a purchase order. Then it passes through the approval phase following the designated release strategies for the company area. Once all necessary approvals have been passed, the purchase order document is generated as a PDF document and sent to the supplier. A registry of received goods and services follows. After declaring receipt, invoices and billing information are also registered.

Each step of the process is carried out by the corresponding stakeholder. Users are added to the workflow as needed for each phase. For example, in level one of the release strategy, the corresponding approver automatically joins the workflow and is removed once they approve or reject the purchase order.
