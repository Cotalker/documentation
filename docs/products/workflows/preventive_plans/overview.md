## Introduction {#intro}

The **Preventive Plans** workflow is the main part of the _Preventive Maintenance_ product. It allows you to create routine maintenance plans that can be triggered either with _time-based_ or _value-based_ metrics. 

Create _time-based_ or _value-based_ plans with the **Create a new preventive plan** form. Through the form you set all of the preventive plan's settings. Assign those that are responsible for the task, add a maintenance checklist, set priority, and most importantly, designate frecuency based on _time_ or equipment _value_ triggers.
