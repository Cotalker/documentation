Sarah's company needs to do routine maintenance on their vehicles. With the **Preventive Maintenance** product, she can create a _preventive plan_ to keep their vehicle maintenance up to date. 

Using the **Create Preventive Plan** form, she has programmed a vehicle maintenance check for every 6,000 miles. Once the trigger goes off, a [work order](/docs/products/workflows/work_orders/related-product/pm/overview_intro) will be sent to all stakeholders.
