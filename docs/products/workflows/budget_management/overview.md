## Introduction {#intro}

After accepting a _work order_, contractors can submit a quote through the work order's _channel_. They can do this by filling out the [**New Quote**](/docs/products/workflows/budget_management/overview) form. This form is tied to master data to help easily choose services and available materials, along with their costs and stocks, respectively.

Once the quote has been submitted, a copy of the quote is sent to a new _channel_ in the **Quotes** section. The _channel_ is integrated by stakeholders that can review and finally approve or reject the quote.

## Example {#example}

### Submitting a Quote {#submit}

<div className="alert alert--primary">

From a work order's channel, after reviewing the details of the incident, Thomas sends a first quote using the **New Quote** form from the work order's channel. 

<img alt="send quote" className="img_sizing item shadow--tl" src={useBaseUrl('img/products/video_new_quote.gif')} />
<br/>

The supervisor will be able to see the quote in the work order's channel. Additionally, the quote is sent to a new channel in the Quotes section that incorporates the company's budget manager and other stakeholders.

### Approving a Quote {#approval}

<div className="alert alert--primary">

John, the budget manager, sees the new quote notification. To review the quote, he enters the quote's channel and will be able to approve or reject it.

<img alt="send quote" className="img_sizing item shadow--tl" src={useBaseUrl('img/products/video_quote_approval.gif')} />
<br/>

All stakeholders are also in the channel, allowing them to comment and see the quote's status.
