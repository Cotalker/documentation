## Introduction {#intro}

In a _corrective maintenance_ process, the first step is probably the most important. That's why our [**Corrective Maintenance**](/docs/products/corrective_maintenance/cm_overview) product comes equipped with the **notifications** workflow. Through this workflow, field workers can easily and instantly inform of any malfunctions or failures.

To report a failure, field workers submit a pre-designed form through the Cotalker platform. On the form, users can write a brief description of the problem, choose the damaged equipment from a list, indicate the location, and even add a photo to help evaluate the situation.

Once the form is submitted, the workflow is initiated. Supervisors are notified through the app and will have to either validate or reject the report. A service-level agreement (SLA) routine is also included in the workflow to ensure the issue is dealt with soon.

Further details are given in the following sections.

## Example {#example}

### Water Leak Notification {#water-leak}

_Watch how Azam sends a notification to report a maintenance issue in 30 seconds:_

<br/>

_Detail of Azam's notification process explained step-by-step:_

1. Azam oversees the office in Acme's northern premises. This morning, he found a water leak on the premises.
2. So he opened up the Cotalker platform to send a maintenance notification.
3. He goes to the _Notification_ section, 
4. And presses the _green action button_ and selects the _Report Incident_ option.
5. A form pops up, and he fills it out.
6. He indicates the company location where the incident has happened from a list: _Northern premises_.
7. Then, he indicates what type of asset has suffered a failure. He selects _Water supply_ from the list.
8. After choosing the _Water supply_ option, he indicates if the problem comes from within or outside the premises. So he selects the _Internal_ option to inform that the problem is within the premises.
9. He then indicates the failure type. A list of possible failures related to internal water supply issues shows up. He selects _Pipe leak_.
10. Next, he registers the date and time the incident happened.
11. Before submitting, he adds a photo to explain the incident better.
12. Finally, he presses the _Send_ button on the form to notify Layla, the maintenance supervisor.
13. This commences the _Notification_ workflow. In the next step of the process, Layla will have to _validate the report_. Once validated, she can then create a _work order_, starting a new workflow that will include the contractor assigned to fix the leak (more on this later).

### Water Leak Report Validation {#validation}

_Details of how Layla validated Azam's report:_

1. Once Azam sends in the report, Layla, the maintenance supervisor, gets notified immediately.
2. She opens up the notification channel.
3. Then, she scrolls up the channel to look at the details of the report.
4. In the channel workspace, she presses the green button labeled _Validate Incident_.
5. The _Validate Incident Notification_ form pops up.
6. She chooses to validate, and adds a note before submitting the form.
7. Once the incident is validated, from the same workspace, Layla can send contractors a _work order_ requesting their services. This will commence the [work order workflow](/docs/products/workflows/work_orders/overview).
8. To be continued...



## Glossary {#vocabulary}

- **Corrective Maintenance (CM)**: Maintenance that is done after a failure has occurred.
- **Work Order (WO)**: An authorized request to complete a maintenance task containing relative information.
- **Form**: A dynamic survey form generated within the Cotalker platform. It is linked to the company's master data, enabling users to choose failures according to section and equipment.
- **Notification**: A automatically generated message sent within the corrective maintenance group, where users have access to a workspace to respond to notifications and other messages. Depending on the business or industrial sector, _notifications_ can also be known as _alerts_ or _incidents_.
