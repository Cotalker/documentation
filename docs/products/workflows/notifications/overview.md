## Introduction {#intro}

In a _corrective maintenance_ process, the first step is probably the most important. That's why our [**Corrective Maintenance**](/docs/products/corrective_maintenance/cm_overview) product comes equipped with the **notifications** workflow. Through this workflow, field workers can easily and instantly inform of any malfunctions or failures.

To report a failure, field workers submit a pre-designed form through the Cotalker platform. On the form, users can write a brief description of the problem, choose the damaged equipment from a list, indicate the location, and even add a photo to help evaluate the situation.

Once the form is submitted, the workflow is initiated. Supervisors are notified through the app and will have to either validate or reject the report. A service-level agreement (SLA) routine is also included in the workflow to ensure the issue is dealt with soon.

Further details are given in the following sections.
