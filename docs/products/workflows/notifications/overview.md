In a **corrective maintenance** process, the first step is probably the most important. With the **notifications** workflow, field workers can easily and instantly inform of any malfunctions or failures.

To report a failure, field workers submit a pre-designed form through the Cotalker platform. On the form, users can write a brief description of the problem, choose the damaged equipment from a list, indicate the location, and even add a photo to help evaluate the situation.

Once the form is submitted, the workflow is initiated. A supervisor will be notified through the app. A service-level agreement (SLA) routine is also included in the workflow to ensure deadlines are met.
