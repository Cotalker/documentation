## Introduction {#intro}

Cotalker _products_ are ready-to-use solutions that address specific organizational needs commonly found in businesses and industries. They are built upon our low-code workflow management platform. The platform provides all the power to automate and make your processes more efficient, which means that _products_ can be customized to meet your company's requirements.
