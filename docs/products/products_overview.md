## Introduction {#intro}

Cotalker _products_ are built upon our low-code workflow management platform. The platform provides all the power to automate and make your processes more efficient.

Speak with a [Cotalker commercial representative](/docs/support/commercial) on how to implement products for your company.

## Product-Related Workflows: {#product-related-workflows}
Products include a wide range of interacting workflows to meet solution requirements. 
_Workflows_ and their use within _products_ are described in the following sections. 

In this documentation, we present the following product-related workflows:
- Notifications

For each workflow description, you will find:
- an overview of the product's workflow processes, their interconnections, and automations, 
- adding and managing master data, 
- setting up user profiles and access roles, 
- gathering data from users and automating processes through surveys
- integrating with other systems, like ERP, using our REST API tools
