## Introduction {#intro}

Cotalker _products_ are ready-to-use solutions that address specific organizational needs commonly found in businesses and industries. They are built upon our low-code workflow management platform.

## Examples {#examples}
### Service Station Maintenance {#service-station}

Let's say a service station worker discovers a problem with a gas pump. How do they communicate this and get it fixed? Easy. They just have to open the Cotalker app on their smartphone to report the failure. They can even add a photo of the maintenance issue to help the team evaluate the problem.

<br/>

Once the report is submitted, the zone supervisor gets automatically notified on their Cotalker app. The supervisor reviews the submitted information and has the option of either disregarding the incident or validating it. After validating, the supervisor can submit a work order that is sent to available contractors, who are also connected through the Cotalker platform. 

The notified contractors can accept or decline the work order. If they accept, they are added to the workflow process. Once they are on terrain and evaluate the incident for themselves, they can send a quote by submitting a form from the task workspace. The quote is automatically shared with the budget manager.

<br/>

After the contractors consider they have finished their job, they request to close the work order through a corresponding form. The supervisor can then review the job and decide to approve it or not. Once approved, the work order is closed.

It's that simple!
