## Why use our Preventive Maintenance product? {#why}
It's better to be safe than sorry. With Cotalker's **Preventive Maintenance** product, you'll be able to keep all your routine maintenance checks on track. Choose between time or value metrics to trigger maintenance alerts. Once a time or value trigger is reached, a work order is automatically sent to maintenance personnel and contractors.


## How does it work? {#how}
**Preventive Maintenance** has two types of _preventive plans_ to help you stay up to date on all your maintenance tasks. Plans can be set to track maintenance needs either by time or value metrics. 

### Time-Based Planner {#time}
For example, if you need to do maintenance on a machine every day, you can set the time trigger to 24 hours. Every 24 hours the [work orders workflow](/docs/products/workflows/work_orders/overview_intro) will be initiated. A work order will be automatically sent to the contractor or maintenance personnel. If they choose to accept the work order, they can send a quote, send messages to stakeholders, and request to close the work order. To finally close the workflow, the supervisor must evaluate the completed maintenance job and fill out the _Acceptance of Work_ form.

### Value-Based Planner {#value}
Let's say that you have to do maintenance on a car every 6,000 miles. In this case, you can use value-based planner. Once the plan is created, maintenance personnel will periodically use the app to register value metrics, like mileage or fluid levels for a vehicle. And, when the car's registered mileage hits 12,000 miles, the value trigger will kick in and get things ready for the car's second maintenance check. At this point, the [work orders workflow](/docs/products/workflows/work_orders/overview_intro) will initiate, and a work order will be sent to the person in charge of the car's maintenance.

Create a time-based or value-based plan with the **Create a new preventive plan** form. The form lets you set all of the preventive plan's settings. For example, assign those that are responsible for the task, add a maintenance checklist, set priority, and most importantly, designate frequency based on time or equipment value triggers.

Once a time or value trigger is reached, a _work order_ is automatically sent to stakeholders. Upon receiving the work order, contractors can review the details and decide whether to accept the job or not. Contractors can then submit a _quote_ form that is shared with stakeholders for review. Contractors send the _close work order_ form upon job completion for the supervisor's approval.
