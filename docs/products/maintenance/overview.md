## Why "Maintenance"? {#why}

Sometimes things break. And when that happens, you need to fix them as soon as possible. But the process between reporting a maintenance issue and actually solving the problem can take some time. Cotalker's **Maintenance** product offers a mobile solution to fieldwork problems, agilizing the process with its notification forms, work orders, automations, and direct communication with all stakeholders.

## How does Maintenance work? {#how}

**Maintenance** consists of four integrated workflows that connect stakeholders together, allowing them to report incidents, share information, and request validation to pass to the next stage in the process.

_Maintenance workflows:_
  - [Notifications](/docs/products/maintenance/corrective_maintenance/overview): Notify failures by filling out a form. This initiates the workflow.
  - [Preventive Maintenance](/docs/products/maintenance/preventive_maintenance/overview)
  - [Work Orders](/docs/products/maintenance/work_orders/overview)
  - [Budget Management](/docs/products/maintenance/budget_management/overview)

## Examples {#examples}
### Service Station Maintenance {#service-station}

<br/>

Let's say a service station worker discovers a problem with a gas pump. How do they communicate this and get it fixed? Easy. They just have to open the Cotalker app on their smartphone to report the failure. They can even add a photo of the maintenance issue to help the team evaluate the problem.

Once the report is submitted, the zone supervisor gets automatically notified on their Cotalker app. The supervisor then reviews the submitted information and has the option of either disregarding the incident or validating it. After validating, the supervisor can submit a work order that is sent to available contractors, also through Cotalker. 

The notified contractors can accept or decline the work order. If they accept, they are added to the workflow process. Once they are in terrain and evaluate the incident for themselves, they can send a quote by submitting a form from the task workspace. The quote is automatically shared with finance department.

<br/>

After the contractors consider they have finished their job, they close the work order by submitting another form. The supervisor can then approve or reject the job. Once approved, the work order is closed.

It's that simple!
