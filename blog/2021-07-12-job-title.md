A job title is more than just a label. It's about how we relate to each other and the responsibilities we have. Our new **job titles** remake helps express this idea in the Cotalker environment assigning _attributes_ to _users_ within the "pool" of the _job title_. This new feature allows the creation of groups of _users_ with shared behavior amongst them. One possible implementation of this feature could be managing employee work shifts. Contact your Cotalker representative for more information on how to take advantage of _job titles_.
