Communication within your processes is vital. But sometimes, words aren't enough. That's why we've added even more emojis for channel workspace messages, making interaction among those involved in a task quicker and more effective. Apart from the wide range of emojis added, we've included an emoji search option and a recently used section. Have fun being productive! üöÄ
