title: User-Interface & Search Update
description: For work to be productive, you need your tools to be correctly organized and know where everything is. That's why we made some changes to our user interface, adding a toolbar to give you easy access to the search tool and contact list.  TheÂ search toolÂ has also been enhanced to make it even easier to search through your data. Search queries can now even go through your shared documents and notes, allowing your company to make easier use of its growing knowledge base.
