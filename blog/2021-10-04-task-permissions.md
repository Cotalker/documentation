title: Task Followers & Editors
description: We make it easier to keep a bird's-eye view of what's going on in your company. With the new task followers and task editors option, supervisors and other stakeholders can follow or edit all the tasks within a task group. This new feature simplifies configuring which users can participate in tasks without necessarily having to add them one by one in the list of users assigned to the task. Stay close to your teams, but with enough distance to let them work freely. Ask your admin to configure this option through the API.
