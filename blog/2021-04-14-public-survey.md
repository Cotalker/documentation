Good things are meant to be shared. That's why we've now implemented survey sharing outside the Cotalker environment. By simply sharing the link, anybody can now start a workflow or create a task.  For example, through a shared link, customers who recur for support can fill out a form with their issue and automatically create a Cotalker task that would act as a support ticket. We call this feature a _public survey_.
