title: Channel Workspace Restyled
description: We restyled our channel workspaces to make the visual design across the Cotalker platform more consistent. This update aims to provide a user interface that helps users navigate seamlessly through tasks and channels. You will notice that changes have been made to the group panel's channel and title bars. Also, the channel workspace settings panel has been updated. Enjoy!
