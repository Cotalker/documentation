title: Webhook Event Triggers
description: Configure webhooks to set triggers that automatically send event data to another server in real time. This feature allows data collected by Cotalker to be sent and used in other systems. For example, a user can submit a form powered by Cotalker, and the data is immediately sent to an external server for further use. Things like purchase orders, maintenance notifications, and much more can be easily shared with other systems. Webhooks expand Cotalker's capabilities, making it the all-in-one solution your company needs.
