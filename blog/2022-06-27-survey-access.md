title: Developer Mode Survey Access
description: So far, users have been able to access surveys on channel workspaces according to different settings that act as filters determining the survey's availability. But now, with the new developer mode, you can also program an extra layer of logic to determine whether or not a survey should be available. Use task details, like states or other data, to decide if and when a survey can be used by users in the channel. With a small code script, you can easily automate the finest details of your processes.
