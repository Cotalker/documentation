title: Offline Mode Update
description: We've just performed a massive overhaul in Cotalker's Offline Mode, including a refreshing facelift on the settings menu and background syncing with a lighter, faster synchronization process. The settings menu has been revamped, making it more visually appealing, and now with its own sliding menu for Offline Mode options. Users will now benefit from a more expeditious, efficient process of synchronizing data for Offline Mode, while using the app or not! Background synchronization has been enabled so that users can keep the app open in the background and rest assured that once they hop back in, all their data will be up to date, and Offline Mode will be ready to use.
