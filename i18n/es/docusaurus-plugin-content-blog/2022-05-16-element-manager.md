title: Element Manager
description: Elements are the key to managing data within the Cotalker environment. Elements can represent assets, determine workflow characteristics, indicate survey availability, filter task permissions, and much more. Handling elements and the intricate connection between them can sometimes seem complicated, especially when elements have various levels of child or sub-elements. To improve user experience, we decided to implement a new Element Manager. The new user interface employs a hierarchical tree display that lets you view all levels of elements and sub-elements at a glance and edit them accordingly.
