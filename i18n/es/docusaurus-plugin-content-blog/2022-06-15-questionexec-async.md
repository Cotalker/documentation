title: Question Code Automations Update
description: Question Code Automations, a.k.a. QuestionExec, allows you to add custom code to your survey questions to validate answer input, auto-complete fields, and add logic based on business rules. And now, with this update, asynchronous functions have been enabled, more parameters added, and auto-fill response capabilities have been improved. Among other possibilities, the newly introduced asynchronicity allows communicating with external servers through network requests. This means that your survey can send and receive data through API requests, making it possible, for example, to use databases to validate user input and auto-fill fields.
