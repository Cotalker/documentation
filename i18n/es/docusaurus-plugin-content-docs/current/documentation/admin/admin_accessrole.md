<br />

In this section of the _administrative panel_, you can create, search, check and download the company's access roles.

An _access role_ is a set of previously arranged _permissions_ assignable to _users_ by administrators.

Within a company, _users_ fulfill different roles. It is important to assign specific _permissions_ to some _users_ and not to others. Assigning _access roles_ permits the quick designation of the sets of _permissions_ that _users_ will need to read or modify something in the application. The access given can go from answering a _survey_ from a specific _channel_ to configuring the _administrative panel_.

There is a wide range of default _permissions_ to choose from, but personalized ones can also be created. Created _permissions_ are given functionalities when other models are configured.
