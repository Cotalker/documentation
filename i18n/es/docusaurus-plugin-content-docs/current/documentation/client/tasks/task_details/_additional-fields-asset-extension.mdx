### D. Additional Fields (extensions) {#additional-fields-extensions}
_Extra tabs with additional fields are added to task details._

_Example:_

<img alt="general info" className="img_sizing item shadow--tl" src={useBaseUrl('img/admin_workflowgroup_channel_06.png')} />
<br/>

Extra tabs with [additional fields](/docs/documentation/admin/database/admin_collections#additional-fields) vary depending on the selected collection.

The collection's name is used as the title of the extra tab, and its additional fields are included within the tab.
In the [Create/Edit Workflow](/docs/documentation/admin/workflows/settings_panels/workflow_create_edit#additional-fields) settings panel you can choose which collections are used to create extra tabs and additional fields. Up to fifty collections can be selected.

Extra tabs with additional fields are optional and vary according to your organization's needs.

The selected collections are found in the `allowdExtensions` field in the [COTSMStateMachine data model](/docs/documentation/models/tasks/model_statemachine).

[Click here](/docs/documentation/admin/workflows/settings_panels/workflow_create_edit#workflow-additional-fields) to learn more about the difference between the two types of additional fields.
