<span className="hero__subtitle">A task is the representation of an asset and its state.</span>

In general, a **task** is _something_ that _someone_ has to do but can be much more than that.

<div className="margin margin-left--lg">

‚úèÔ∏è The Cotalker platform, digitalizes a real-life **task or asset** and places it within a _lifecycle or process_.  
‚ô∫ This _lifecycle or process_ is known in Cotalker as a [**workflow**](/docs/documentation/client/basic_concepts#workflows).  
ü™ú Each step of the process or _workflow_ is called a [**state**](/docs/documentation/client/basic_concepts#state).  

</div>

_Here are just some examples of tasks and their possible states within a workflow:_

<div className="align-center">
