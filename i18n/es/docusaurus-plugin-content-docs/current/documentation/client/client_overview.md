## Introductory note {#intro}

There are basically two kinds of Cotalker users:
- _End-users_: use Cotalker to plan, execute, and communicate information. 
- _Administrators_: Also known as _admins_, build arbitrary workflows and processes.

**The Basics** section contains everything an _end-user_ needs to know (basic tools and graphic user interface).
First-time _admins_ will also benefit from this section.


:::tip For Admins:
For more in-depth information for administrators, please refer to the [Admin Docs](/docs/documentation/documentation_overview) section.
