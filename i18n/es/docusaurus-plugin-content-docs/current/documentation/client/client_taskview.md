As the name implies, a _task_ is 'something' that 'someone' has to do. _Tasks_ are found within a _workflow group_. They can be created manually or through _surveys_. Our tools permit _tasks_ to be assigned, monitored, and updated.

Through the *task button* – found on top of the _group_ menu bar – you can access the _tasks view_.

<!-- TODO insert image of task button in group menu bar -->

## Tasks Views {#tasks-views}
_Tasks views_ are an easy way to search for and manage tasks, along with getting a general idea of ​​the status of tasks in your company. Furthermore, it can also cover the visualization of other implemented solutions, such as a company client's statuses.

There are three different _tasks views_. Each view permits different ways to visualize and handle the data.
- List view
- Kanban view
- Table view

## Buttons {#buttons}
From the *button bar* on the top of the _tasks_ screen you can access the different _tasks views_ as well as other tools, like _filters_ and the creation of _new tasks_.

| Action Name | Image | Description |
| ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| Create | <img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('img/taskview_add.png')} /> | Create a task/item |
| Reset | <img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('img/taskview_reset.png')} /> | Reload the page |
| Collapse | <img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('img/taskview_collapse.png')} /> | Collapse the tasks/items |
| Expand | <img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('img/taskview_expand.png')} /> | Expand the tasks/items |
| Search | <img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('img/taskview_search.png')} /> | Search for tasks/items by name |
| Filter | <img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('img/taskview_filter.png')} /> | Filter display |
| List View | <img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('img/taskview_listview.png')} /> |Vertical order |
| Kanban View | <img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('img/taskview_kanvanview.png')} /> |Horizontal order |
| Table View | <img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('img/taskview_tableview.png')} /> |Sort by process |

## Create a Filter {#create-a-filter}
Customizing the display of elements is crucial. You can sort or filter them through multiple criteria – e.g., item status, the task's assigned user, etcetera. Up to three filters and three sorting criteria can be used per view.

When creating a filter for the first time, press the *filter button* in the top menu bar. A small *cog icon* will appear. Press it to open the *filter dialog box*. 

Once you are done adjusting the filters in the dialog box, it's possible to *save the filter* as a preset, so the next time the _task view_ is accessed, the saved filter will be shown as an option next to the *filter button*.

We can see the *filter dialog box* in the following picture:
<img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('img/taskview_filtercreate2.png')} width= "40%" height= "40%"/> <br/>
<img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('img/taskview_filtercreate1.png')} width= "40%" height= "40%"/>

## Creating and Modifying Tasks {#creating-and-modifying-tasks}

_Tasks_ can be generated automatically through _surveys_ but they can also be created manually. Once in the _task views_, you can **create a task** by pressing the corresponding icon in the menu bar. A dialog box will open with all the options needed to name the new task, assign it to someone, establish its status and deadline, among others.

In some configurations, administrators might program a _required survey_ to appear when creating a new task. This feature permits _administrators_ make sure that _users_ correctly fill out all the necessary information for a _task_ and help teams stay informed of all created _tasks_.

You can also modify existing tasks by simply choosing one from the task view. A dialog box will open where you can view and edit the task's properties. Again, if programmed by the administrator, a _required survey_ window might appear.
