You can access Cotalker through different platforms or user interfaces (UI): *Web client* version and *Mobile* version ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cotalker.android) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/cl/app/cotalker/id1121103618)). Each platform offers a similar experience through its design so that users can easily pass from one device to another.



## Web Client Platform {#web-client-platform}
Access to Cotalker Web Client: [https://web.cotalker.com](https://web.cotalker.com)

This platform permits the most versatile use. Because it runs through a web browser, it can be perfectly used in any operating system and without major hardware requirements. Although mainly used for desktops, the web app adapts itself to mobile devices through its responsive design. All of this permits users to log into Cotalker from any computer or device without needing to install an app.

*The lastest version of Chrome is recommended for the best performance.*
