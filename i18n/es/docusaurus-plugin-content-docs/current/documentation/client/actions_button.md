## Overview {#overview}

Action buttons allow users to carry out all sorts of actions related to groups, channels, and tasks. There are two types of action buttons: _group panel action button_ and _channel workspace action button_.

## Group Panel Actions Button {#group-panel}

The _Actions button_ is a green button floating near the bottom of the [group panel](/docs/documentation/client/groups#group-panel). It can perform the following actions:
- In [_workflow groups_](/docs/documentation/client/groups#workflow-groups), create [tasks](/docs/documentation/client/taskview) with surveys.
- In [_standard groups_](/docs/documentation/client/groups#regular-groups), create new [channels](/docs/documentation/client/channels).
- In all groups, there can be links to any URL.

_The Group Panel's **actions button** will look something like the image below:_
<img alt="fab" className="img_sizing item shadow--lw" src={useBaseUrl('img/client_actionsbutton_01.png')} />
<br/>

Click anywhere in the darkened area to exit the _actions button menu_.

## Channel Workspace Actions Button {#task-menus-within-channel}
The _Actions button_ is found near the bottom of the [_channel workspace_](/docs/documentation/client/channels).
You can change a _task's_ state from its _channel workspace_ by using the _actions button_.
If configured, you can also answer any survey associated with the channel by pressing the _actions button_.

_The Channel Workspace's **actions button** will look something like the image below:_

<img alt="task change state menu" className="img_sizing item shadow--tl" src={useBaseUrl('img/client_channels_actions_00.png')} />
