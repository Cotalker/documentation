## Platform Versions {#versions}

<div className="alert alert--info">

To access Cotalker, you can choose among three different platforms:

- [**Web client**](#web-client-platform) 
- _Mobile versions:_
  - [**Android**](#mobile-apps)
  - [**iOS**](#cotalker-ios-app). 
  
_Each platform offers a similar experience through its design so that users can easily pass from one device to another._

</div>
<br/>

## Web Client Platform {#web-client-platform}

<div className="alert alert--secondary">

1. From your favorite web browser, go to [https://web.cotalker.com](https://web.cotalker.com).

  This platform permits the most versatile use. Because it runs through a web browser, it can be perfectly used in any operating system and without major hardware requirements. Although mainly used for desktops, the web app adapts itself to mobile devices through its responsive design. All of this permits users to log into Cotalker from any computer or device without needing to install an app.
  
  :::note
  *The latest version of Chrome is recommended for best performance.*

## Mobile Apps {#mobile-apps}

For those who are constantly on the go or doing fieldwork, our _mobile apps_ – for both Android and iOS – are a game-changer. Cotalker's mobile apps maintain the feel of the web app's design, permitting users to easily switch from one graphic user interface to another. And in case you don't have internet access, the mobile app has an offline mode that permits you to keep working and sychronize everything once you're back online.
