_Surveys_ are a significant feature inside the Cotalker environment. Taking a form-like aspect, _surveys_ are incorporated within _channels_. They are created by _administrators_ and can be associated with _tasks_, permitting automatic interaction with workflows.

Different data can be retrieved through the _surveys_, such as written text, multiple-choice questions, date and time, ratings, location, and even QR Code and NFC input on mobile apps.

Some _surveys_ will require you to sign your name using any pointing device, such as a mouse or your finger if using a mobile device.

_Surveys_ can also be interactive. Depending on the answer given to a question, new questions will appear on the form.
