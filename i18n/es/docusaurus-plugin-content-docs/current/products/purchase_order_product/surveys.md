## Overview {#overview}

The **Purchase Orders Workflow** counts with various customizable _survey forms_ to help users carry out each step in the process. _Survey forms_ can access your company's master data, allowing users to obtain information to choose from in the corresponding fields. Submitted data is used throughout the process to determine the path of the workflow algorithm, update values, and calculate costs.

Workflow configurations and user _access roles_ determine who has access to the survey forms and the options they can choose from within them.
