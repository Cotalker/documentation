<span className="hero__title">Service Order PDF</span>
<br/>
<br/>

After being released, the service order is automatically generated in PDF format. The PDF document contains all the information gathered through the forms and fetched in the master data. The fetched data includes client and provider information, service and material costs, totals, and the approver's signature.

The PDF document is obtained through a link posted in the channel workspace.

:::info
If the service order is modified afterward, a new version of the PDF document is automatically generated.
