## Overview {#overview}
Survey forms help service providers generate service orders. Master data is connected with the survey forms, allowing users to enter client information and service details with a click. 

Users with certain administrative privileges can add or update the master data used as options in survey form fields. Plus, more data is collected with each submitted form, allowing service providers to use this data to generate dashboards that help them visualize their service order data.
