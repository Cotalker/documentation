<br/>

After the service order has been created, it is sent to a supervisor or coordinator for its release approval. 
In the channel workspace, supervisors can review the service order and then must indicate their approval or rejection by filling out the release form.

The service order is generated in PDF format and made available through the channel workspace upon acceptance.

## Accessing the Form {#access}

<div className="alert alert--secondary">

_To access the service order and fill out the release form:_

<img alt="release form" className="img_sizing item shadow--tl" src={useBaseUrl('img/products/product_serviceorder_survey_03.png')} />
<br/>

<div className="margin margin-left--lg">

1. Press <span className="badge badge--primary">Service orders</span> from the **Main Menu Bar**.
2. In the **Service orders** panel, choose the created service order to review.
3. The service order's channel workspace opens up. In it, all the details of the service order can be found.
4. Press the <span className="badge badge--success">Release service order</span> button found at the bottom of the channel workspace to open the release form.

## Form Layout {#layout}

_The release form appears as shown below:_

<div className="alert alert--secondary">

<img alt="release form" className="img_sizing_small item shadow--tl" src={useBaseUrl('img/products/product_serviceorder_survey_04.png')} />
<br/>

Answering **Yes** takes the workflow to the next stage. If the service is not released, the workflow is closed, and the job is not performed.

The supervisor's signature is also required and will be included in the autogenerated PDF document of the service order.
