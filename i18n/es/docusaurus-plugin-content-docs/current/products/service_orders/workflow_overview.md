The **Service Orders Workflow** guides _service providers_ step-by-step in their _service order_ processes. The workflow starts when an authorized user fills out a form to submit a _service order_ for approval. Next, a supervisor or coordinator within the company is given a form to indicate whether they approve or reject the _service order_. In the following step, _field workers_ are incorporated into the workflow. They can view the _service order_ from the workflow's channel workspace. On the same channel workspace, the _field workers_ can indicate if the job was completed as specified in the _service order_, if adjustments were needed to be made to the _service order_ to complete the job, or if the job was not performed at all.

The channel workspace allows those involved in the service order to maintain permanent communication, share information, and stay informed of the task's current status.

A PDF format version of the service order is generated when it is approved and each time a modification is introduced.
