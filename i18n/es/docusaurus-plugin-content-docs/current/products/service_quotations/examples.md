## Introduction {#intro}

Layla works for a small farming company that needs to drill a well. She found a company called Lorem that does just that. Lorem uses Cotalker Service Quotations to allow its clients and prospects to request a quotation. On their website, there's a link that opens up a form powered by Cotalker. Layla opens the link and enters her company's contact info and service request on the form. Once submitted, the well-drilling company will get notified.

On the other side, Ogechi, who works for Lorem, receives the request and opens up a form to generate a service quotation. The form is connected to the company's master data, so Ogechi only has to select the corresponding items from the menu. The form will automatically calculate costs, generate the service quotation with all the details, and send it to the email that Layla stipulated on the request form.


## Send Request {#send-request}
Layla fills out the form she found on the web page.

## Accept Request {#accept-request}
Ogechi, sees that a new quotation request has arrived. She looks at the requirements and accepts the petition for a quote.


## Create Quotation {#create-quotation}
From the channel workspace, Ogechi opens the Create Quotation form. The form is linked to the company's master data, letting her choose all available options for services, materials, and workers for the job. 

The form will automatically calculate costs, generates the quotation, and sends it via email to the client.

## Quotation Approval {#quotation-approval}
Layla sees that she has received an email from the drilling company. The service quotation is attached in the email as a PDF document. The email also contains a link that opens a new form, where she can choose to accept the quotation and now formally request Lorem's services.

## Service Order Creation {#service-order}
Once Layla accepts the quotation, Ogechi can see that the service order workflow has been automatically initiated. The workflow includes the service order document generated with all the data that was on the service quotation.
