## Create Work Order {#create-wo}

<div className="alert alert--primary">

Layla is a supervisor in her company. She just received a _notification_ about a water leak in the northern premises through the Cotalker platform. She will use the same Cotalker channel to create a work order requesting a contractor's services. To do this, she will fill out the **Create Work Order** form, as shown below.

<img alt="create work order" className="img_sizing item shadow--tl" src={useBaseUrl('img/products/video_create_work_order.gif')} />
<br/>

Once submitted, the _Work Order_ workflow is initiated, and the work order is sent to contractors.

</div>
