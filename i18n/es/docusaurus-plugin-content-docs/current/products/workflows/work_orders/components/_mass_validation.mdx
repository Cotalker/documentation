After contractors or maintenance teams submit the **Close Work Order** form, supervisors must validate job completion. Work orders are officially closed after validation. Sometimes, a supervisor's job can be overwhelming with large amounts of completed jobs that need validating. To ease this difficulty, supervisors can recur to the **Mass Validation** tool. With it, supervisors can request a report of all requests to close work orders that need validation, and they can choose to do a mass closure which validates all of these jobs and ultimately closes the work orders.

## Mass Validation {#mass-validation}

_To access the **Mass Validation** tool:_
