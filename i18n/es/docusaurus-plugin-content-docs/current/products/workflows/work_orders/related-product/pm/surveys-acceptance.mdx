## Work Order Reception {#reception}

Once contractors or maintenance personnel request to close the work order, supervisors must fill out the **Work Order Reception** form to either approve or reject the maintenance job. If approved, the work order is officially closed. If rejected, the work order goes back to the pending workflow state.

<div className="alert alert--primary">

_To open the form:_

<img alt="accessing form" className="img_sizing item shadow--tl" src={useBaseUrl('img/products/product_preventive_wo_acceptance_00.png')} />
<br/>

1. Select <span className="badge badge--primary">Work orders</span> on the **Main Menu Bar**.
2. From the **Work orders** panel, choose the corresponding work order in the _Validation_ state.
3. Press the green actions button found at the bottom of the channel workspace. The **Work order reception** form opens up as shown below.

Either accept or reject the maintenance job. Accepting will close the work order; rejecting will take the work order back to the pending state.

The form permits adding guarentees that cover maintenance costs.
