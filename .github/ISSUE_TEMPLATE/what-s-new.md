Pilots will be able to go to the moon in less than an hour. This will allow spaceships to go and return on the same day. The new rockets will be made of a new secret material that doesn't heat up at all, this technological change allows us to use newly developed engine power source for inter-galaxy travel. 

# Changes for Users
Users will be able to travel in less than an hour to the moon, starting from you closest starbase. Tickets will be available in all stations. This service will have a new pricing TBA.
